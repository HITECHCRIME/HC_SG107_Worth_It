## Lyrics

```
bitch??? i’m
like the floor is low ha
feeling too much fun

- complacent
- distresses
etching my 
shape

so she told me 
that was all
she could do
fine 
she did not 
realize her own lies

your not worth it

she could hold
in her heart

oh i know

——

vanish for days
tracking a trace
cold for a treat
look at my face
bitch 

gettin’ erased
coz you ain’t worth it

all perspectives
so confirmed
there’s one
only yours 
bitch

——


did all you could ha?
well that ain’t too much
where the other side?


told me all 
she can she
did well ain’t
too much from
you then




this one witch, oh sorry bitch
told me all she can she did
well bitch ain’t too much from you
never was never was

oh wait you 
you’re not sorry, you’re just teasing

it’s been SO long in passing since i scheduled a trace
not asking show memory what queries i faced
such a dream bordering at de ja vu line to not cross
into dark thoughts won’t get you home 

leave you stranded for days
x
leave you stranded for days

it’s been SO long in passing since i scheduled a trace
not asking show memory what queries i faced

such memory bordering at de ja vu line to not cross
into dark thoughts they won’t get you home 

leave you stranded for days

caught in the net so slow 
ya can’t reach them heights from afar 
get ahold of the switch

blowing chances to fold
prep for a breach and withholding all the data
don’t give it to the witch

most of the days just drifting me up so 7 + 1
slide the damn scale, can’t believe what i’m saying
 if you really turn up 7

maybe i should tough it out once 
you said dust goes down 7
now i doubt it will ever happen blood 7

blame for thirst - old dychotomy 8
sordid blatant hypocrisy shown

soooometimes i get things right
even if involves 
losses some abound

all my thoughts used to roll with the tide
fall with emotions, rationals, lost in the pride
so strong can’t deny 
 it’s the price of honour
